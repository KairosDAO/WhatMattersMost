    The Zionist Creed, Isaiah 62, resonates with more amplitude every new day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Indeed, you are already on that path, as are we, and this is our Way to Amplify our efforts in Resonance with Yeshua’s own Words (Revelation 19.10).
  </p>

  <p>
    As explained in the linked presentation, our unprecedented toolkit for this prophetic work in Yeshua’s Name is the greatest collection of Stewardship tech IP ever assembled, combined with the Messianic Hebrew / Evangelical Christian ethos to get the job done.

    Our Board, Officers and initiatives are wholly aligned with all tenets of Messianic Judaism and Evangelical Christianity, so this is WAY MORE than just about money, it’s about Luke 19.13 King-dominion Business.
